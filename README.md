## 🧭 About Me

I’m an HR professional with over **10 years of experience** across **IT, Staffing, FMCG, Manufacturing, and Export-Import** industries. 
I combine **strategic HR leadership** with a passion for **data analytics, automation, and AI-driven transformation** — helping organizations make smarter, people-centered decisions.  

I’m passionate about using data and technology to optimize HR operations, enhance employee engagement, and drive organizational performance.
