## 🧭 About Me

I’m an HR professional with over **10 years of experience** across **IT, BPO, Staffing, FMCG, Manufacturing, and Export-Import** industries. 
I combine **strategic HR leadership** with a passion for **data analytics, automation, and AI-driven transformation** — helping organizations make smarter, people-centered decisions.  

I’m passionate about using data and technology to optimize HR operations, enhance employee engagement, and drive organizational performance.
With hands-on experience in **HR Technology Implementation (SAP, Oracle Fusion, SuccessFactors)** and **Workforce Analytics**, I focus on aligning business outcomes with employee success.  

My goal is to combine technology, analytics, and human capital to build high-performing, people-first organizations. Whether it’s optimizing HR processes or visualizing data trends, I aim to bridge the gap between HR strategy and data intelligence. Over the years, I’ve developed a deep interest in HR Analytics and Power BI, leveraging data to uncover actionable insights that empower organizations to make smarter workforce decisions. 


> “Human potential meets data intelligence — that’s the future of work I strive to build.”
